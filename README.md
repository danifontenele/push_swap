# push_swap
In this project I create a program that get random data and sort it in ascending order with the use of 2 stacks. The goal is sort the numbers with small number of actions as possible.

## The algorythm
To this project I'm using a turk algorythm.

## The stacks
The stacks are data organized like a stack. In this projects I can swap data between this two stacks.

To organize they, I prefer to do it using the concept of circular linked list, in which the "last" node is actualy before the first node.
